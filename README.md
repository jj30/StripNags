I got the idea from a reddit user, who when he encounters a nag screen, just does view-source and reads the article. I ran into the problem today where I needed info from a web site who would have allowed me to sign up with Google -- but wanted acccess to my contacts list. My contacts are as shy as I am, so I slapped this together in an afternoon. 

That is why it is in the 'productivity' section of the extensions store. Because I need it to resume coding my other project.
